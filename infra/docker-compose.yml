    # Note I learned from the old alphagamebot...
    # Use f*cking docker networking instead of just mapping everything to the host.
    # This will make things so much easier. (And yes, of course, I learned this the hard way,
    # because so many services were fighting for the same ports on the host machine...)
    # tl;dr use docker networking, it will be good for your health.

    # When running AlphaGameBot (not included in this compose file), be sure to run this compose file first and
    # add --network=alphagamebot-net to the AlphaGameBot docker run command.  When you need to reference one of these
    # services from AlphaGameBot, just use the service name as the hostname (e.g. "mysql", "prometheus", etc).
    # Also, we are using static IPs here to avoid any possible issues with service discovery.  In theory docker's DNS
    # should handle this, but better safe than sorry.

    # Finally,
